Install for development
-----------------------

The recommended way to install Archivematica for development is with Ansible and
Vagrant. For instructions on how to install Archivematica from a virtual machine,
see the `Ansible & Vagrant Installation instructions
<https://wiki.archivematica.org/Getting_started#Installation>`_ on the Archivematica
wiki. See also instructions for installation on a virtual machine using Vagrant in
the :ref:`Quick Start Guide <quick-start-install>`

.. note:: Archivematica can also be installed for development using Docker and
   Docker Compose. If you would like to take this approach, then follow the
   `Archivematica Docker Compose installation instructions`_.


.. _multiple-machines:

Installing across multiple machines
-----------------------------------

It is possible to spread Archivematica's processing load across several machines
by installing the following services on separate machines:

* Elasticsearch
* gearman
* MySQL

For help, send an email to the `archivematica-tech`_ mailing list.

Firewall
^^^^^^^^

When installing Archivematica on multiple machines, all the machines must be
able to reach each other on the following ports:

* http, mysqld, gearman, nfs, ssh

.. _SSL-support:

Configure Archivematica with SSL
--------------------------------

Archivematica can be configured for HTTPS following the sample configurations for
`dashboard <https://github.com/artefactual-labs/ansible-archivematica-src/blob/qa/1.7.x/templates/etc/nginx/sites-available/dashboard-ssl.conf.j2>`_
and
`storage-service <https://github.com/artefactual-labs/ansible-archivematica-src/blob/qa/1.7.x/templates/etc/nginx/sites-available/storage-ssl.conf.j2>`_.

In order to obtain valid SSL certificates trusted by any browser, you can use `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org>`_.
